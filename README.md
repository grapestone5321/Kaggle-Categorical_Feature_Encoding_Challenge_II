# Kaggle-Categorical_Feature_Encoding_Challenge_II

## Playground Prediction Competition

## Description

Because this is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:

- binary features

- low- and high-cardinality nominal features

- low- and high-cardinality ordinal features

- (potentially) cyclical features


This follow-up competition offers an even more challenging dataset so that you can continue to build your skills with the common machine learning task of encoding categorical variables. 

This challenge adds the additional complexity of feature interactions, as well as missing data.

This Playground competition will give you the opportunity to try different encoding schemes for different algorithms to compare how they perform. 

We encourage you to share what you find with the community.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.


-------

## Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

      id,target
      600000,0.5
      600001,0.5
      600002,0.5
      ...
